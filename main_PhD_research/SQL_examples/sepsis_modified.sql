-- This is a modified version of the sepsis3.sql query that can be found here: https://github.com/MIT-LCP/mimic-iv/blob/master/concepts/sepsis/sepsis3.sql
-- Our modifications add vital signs as well as some patient demographic information about the patients.
-- We take the latest stay_id for a particular subject_id i.e. patient.
-- Creates a table with "onset" time of Sepsis-3 in the ICU.
-- That is, the earliest time at which a patient had SOFA >= 2 and suspicion of infection.
-- As many variables used in SOFA are only collected in the ICU, this query can only
-- define sepsis-3 onset within the ICU.
